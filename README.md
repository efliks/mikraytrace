# Mrtp
A simple raytracing tool to explore programming in C++.

Author: Mikolaj Feliks <mikolaj [dot] feliks [at] gmail [dot] com><br>
Released as open source software under the GNU GPL v3.0 license (see COPYING).

Mrtp builds up on the idea of my earlier program, mrt, 
that I wrote back in 2005 in pure C. The "p" in the name indicates 
"plus" or "progress".

Essentially, the purpose of writing Mrtp was to refresh my knowledge 
of C++, raytracing and computer graphics. Also to experiment with 
linking of a project to third-party libraries, for example png++.

As of now, the program is not fully functional and is under
development.


_Installation instructions:_

Just type in:

```
make
```

An executable file "mrtp" will be generated that is ready to run:

```
./mrtp [config.txt]
```
